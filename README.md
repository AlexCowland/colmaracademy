# Colmar Academy Project

A Codecademy project website for a fictional college. 

#### My style choices
My initial reaction was to take my design decisions down a fairly corporate route. However, after researching other college websites I discovered they tend to by quite creative and playful. With this in mind I decided to go for a petrol and hot pink colour scheme. I pick out the hot pink in the details such as link text and the flashes of colour that appear when hovering over an article. I hope these flashes of colour also help UX focusing the users attention on the hovered article without impeding the view.
